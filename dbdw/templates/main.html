    <p class="text-justify lead">
        Do you enjoy listening to music, do you want to get more insight in your own music taste,
        and do you want to hear some live music again? The <span class="font-weight-bold">JADS Music Night at the Museum</span>
        presents performances in different music styles. Based on your Spotify profile,
        we will recommend which performances either suits you best, or helps you explore new music.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify lead">
        In preparation for the concert, we ask you to follow the steps through this application:
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify lead">
        First, you have to register via your Spotify account. This will allow us to see your top tracks on
        which we can do the recommendations. We also ask for permission to make
        playlists as you will be able to save our recommendations as a playlist to your Spotify account.
        Second, you will have to fill in a small questionnaire about your musical engagement.
        Thirdly, we will show you our recommendations and explanations about which performances fit you best or help you explore new music.
        You have to choose which two of the four performances you would like to listen too during the Music Night.
        Lastly, you will be asked to answer a few questions about your experience with the interface.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify lead">
        Feel free to contact Yu Liang (y.liang1@tue.nl) or Martijn Willemsen (M.C.Willemsen@tue.nl) if you have any questions.
