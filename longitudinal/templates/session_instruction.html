        Session 4 is the final session of the study. In this session, you will login with your Spotify account again.
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Please always use the same Spotify account to login.</span>
        After login, you will need to answer a few questions about the playlist you listened to in the previous session.
        After that, you will be able to adapt the songs as you like using our genre exploration tool
        and get the final playlist to explore the selected genre.
