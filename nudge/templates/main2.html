        To use this app, you are required to login with your active Spotify account.
        This will allow us to get your Spotify top listened tracks to personalise the
        recommendations and it allows you to store the list to your Spotify account
        if you would like. The information that we collect with this app is securely stored
        and will only be used for scientific research, for which your data will be kept anonymous.
        We can only access your Spotify data only when you are using this app.
